\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}
\todo{Intro Web of Documents, missed potential, isolated data sources}

The same applies at the moment to the Vienna University of Technology. In order to find a special location like a certain lecture hall and how it can be accessed without obstacles like stairways, one has to search for information on web sites, scan floor plans and eventually construct a convenient route to the location based on the gathered knowledge. For humans this procedure does not constitute a problem, but think of machines.
\todo{Elaborate on problem for machines, Deep learning, NLP state of the art reference}
 %Web sites are usually designed to present information in a human-readable way and as for images there is in general at the moment of writing no sophisticated approach to interpret such content by machines without additional support of humans. 

As a consequence the barrier for application developers is quite high due to the time consuming task of gathering and extracting the data from multiple sources and transforming it into a representation that is usable by the planned application.

\todo{Linked Data, goal of thesis}

\section{Problem description}
\label{intro-problem-description}

\todo{more comprehensive description}

\begin{itemize}
	\item prototype of a map application based on the transformation of spatial data of the Vienna University of Technology into Linked Data to evaluate and discuss the potential benefits and caveats. 
	\item prototype of an ontology to model spatial data as well as the indoor plans of facilities taking accessibility into consideration. In compliance to best practises terms of already existing ontologies shall be reused whenever possible.
	\item linking of the transformed spatial data with external sources like GeoNames or LinkedGeoData. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Structure of the thesis}
This chapter outlined the motivation for writing this thesis and gave a description of the problems for which a solution will be suggested. The rest of this thesis is structured as follows: Chapter \ref{background-chapter} discusses the basic concepts, principles and technologies that build the foundation of Linked Data and the Semantic Web. It is intended to be a brief introduction for readers that are not familiar with this topic. Chapter \ref{related-work-chapter} provides a summary of past efforts in research and works related to the focus of this thesis. In the subsequent chapter \ref{solution-chapter} a solution for the given problems will be suggested and discussed. This includes the prototype of an ontology that models the problem domain as well as an architectural prototype of a system that manages a subset of spatial data about the Vienna University of Technology in form of Linked Data and provides a human- and machine-friendly interface to it. Finally, the implemented solution is evaluated and conclusions are drawn in the last chapter \ref{discussion-chapter}. It provides furthermore an outlook to future work and potential improvements.

\chapter{Related Work}
\label{related-work-chapter}

In this chapter important efforts and research related to this thesis are outlined. Section \ref{related-work-geospatial-ontologies} describes and evaluates geospatial ontologies that were suggested by \cite{tandy_spatial_????} or discovered in the dataset of \gls{lov} through a systematic search.  

\section{Geospatial ontologies}
\label{related-work-geospatial-ontologies}
This section is going to outline common ontologies for describing geospatial data and to evaluate them from the perspective of the given problem description (see \ref{intro-problem-description}).The ontologies were either be suggested by \cite{tandy_spatial_????} or discovered in the dataset of \gls{lov} by common spatial search terms like \textit{'feature'}, \texit{'geometry'} or \textit{'location'}. \textit{Feature} and \textit{Geometry} are widely used terms in these ontologies and describe two different concepts of geospatial science. A \textit{feature}  is simply a spatial entity that can be everything from a building with fixed position to a movable food truck as long as it has a spatial extent. \textit{Geometry} as the name suggests is a certain geometric shape from points, lines to polygons. Geometric shapes can be used to describe  the spatial extent of \textit{features}.

\subsection{Basic Geo Vocabulary (WGS84)}
\label{related-work-geospatial-ontologies-wgs84}

\gls{geo}\cite{brickley_basic_2003} is a lightweight ontology published by W3C to describe the position of a spatial \textit{feature} using the WGS84 geodetic reference datum\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System}} with the properties \texttt{longitude}, \texttt{latitude} and \texttt{attitude}. The general class \texttt{SpatialThing} is the domain of all these properties. Figure \ref{fig:related-work-geospatial-ontologies:wgs84} shows a visualization of this ontology.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{graphics/vocabularies/wgs84.png}
    \caption{Visualization of Basic Geo Vocabulary}
    \label{fig:related-work-geospatial-ontologies:wgs84}
\end{figure}

Advantages are it`s simplicity and popularity as an analysis of the LOD cloud\cite{research_group:_akws_lodstats_????} indicates. This analysis shows that \gls{geo} is used in \textbf{538} different datasets in the LOD cloud and is thereby the 4th most used ontology regarding usage in different datasets. It is used by big players like DBpedia\footnote{\url{http://dbpedia.org}}, LinkedGeoData\footnote{\url{http://linkedgeodata.org/About}} and GeoNames\footnote{\url{http://linkedgeodata.org/About}}. 
Listing \ref{lst:related-work-geospatial-ontologies:wgs84-dbpedia} shows a data snippet of DBpedia describing the town square 'Karlsplatz' in Vienna with \gls{geo}.

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption=Snippet of DBpedia, label={lst:related-work-geospatial-ontologies:wgs84-dbpedia}]
@prefix dbr:  <http://dbpedia.org/resource/> .
@prefix geo:  <http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#> .

dbr:Karlsplatz  rdf:type  geo:SpatialThing ;
  rdfs:label  "Karlsplatz"@en , "Karlsplatz (Wien)"@de ;
  geo:lat     "48.19916534423828125"^^xsd:float ;
  geo:long    "16.370000839233398438"^^xsd:float .
\end{lstlisting}

\gls{geo} evolved into a standard for presenting the location of points of interest and  as pointed out by best practices \cite{hyland_best_2014}, the use of standardized ontologies to describe one`s data facilitates inclusion into the Web of Data. 

However, this ontology is not sufficient for describing spatial data more complex than a single point in a coordinate reference system.
